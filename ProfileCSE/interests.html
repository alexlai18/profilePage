                <p>I play a lot of video games, but mainly valorant.</p>
                <p>A very sad fun fact is that I've spent a total of $700 on skins 😔.</p>
                <p>Another sad fact: <img src = "images/playtime.png" width = "400"></p>
                <p>Add me on val pls: Laiier #3770</p>
                <p>This is my main agent (the one I play the most):</p>
                <img src = "images/jett.jpg" width="300">
                <p>Favourite Anime at the moment is Classroom of the Elite, but my favourite anime of all time is probably Naruto (just due to sentimental value)</p>

            <h1>🏀 Basketball!</h1>
            <p>I like to play basketball with my friends on the weekend! Here is our local comp team:<img src = "images/team.jpg" width = "400"></p>
            <p>That's me in the back middle!</p>
            <p>I've been playing basketball since I was 12 years old, so it something that I find comfort in.</p>
